     <h3><b>What is IP address?</b></h3>
     <img class="img-fluid" src="{% static 'ipv4.png' %}" width="600" /> <br><br/>
     <h5> 
      An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) defines an IP address as a 32-bit number. This format gives 4,294,967,296, about 4,294 million, possible unique IP addresses. <br><br>
        However, because of the growth of the Internet and the depletion of available IPv4 addresses, a new version of IP (IPv6), using 128 bits for the IP address, was standardized in 1998. IPv6 deployment has been ongoing since the mid-2000s. 
     </h5><br>
  
    <h4><b>Format of IPv4 address</b></h4>
     <h5> 
        The IPv4 address is a 32-bit number that uniquely identifies a network interface on a machine. An IPv4 address is typically written in decimal digits, formatted as four 8-bit fields separated by periods. IPv4 is divided into four octets (each of 8 bits). <br><br>
        A 4-byte IP address is normally represented with 4 decimal numbers separated by dots (.). For example, 34.25.18.1 is a version 4 IP address. Validation of this IP address format is very simple. <br><br>

        But not all IP addresses are assigned to computer hosts on the Internet. A lots of them are reserved for special uses only. Here are some examples of reserved IP address ranges: <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>127.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255: Reserved for loopback and private network use only.</li>
            <li>10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255: Reserved for private network use only.</li>
            <li>192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255: Reserved for private network use only.</li>
            <li>192.88.99.0 - 192.88.99.255: Reserved for IPv6 to IPv4 relay use only.</li>
        </ul>
     </h5>
